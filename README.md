# Exercises for Hacktoberfest

Want to participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) but don't know where to start? Frustrated that all the things you want to work on are already claimed? New to open source and want to make your first PR?

Fork this repository, complete this challenge, and submit a PR. And depending on how far you want to go, you could get all four of your Hacktoberfest pull requests done through this repository.

Ready for the challenge?

## The Challenge

In 2015, I published my book [Exercises for Programmers](http://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb). It's a collection of programming practice problems that are designed to take you through the basics of any programming language. It's perfect for the beginner, but it's great for experienced coders too. For example, you can do each of these exercises while learning Go, Elixir, Ruby, Python, Java, or even iOS or Android development.

The following exercises are publicly available as excerpts from the book.

* [Mad Lib](http://media.pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/madlib.pdf)
* [Self Checkout](http://media.pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/checkout.pdf)
* [Temperature Converter](http://media.pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/converter.pdf)
* [Who's In Space](http://media.pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/space.pdf)


Implement your solution to one (or more) of these challenges in your programming language of choice.

## Rules

* No purchase of [Exercises for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb) is necessary. But it would be greatly appreciated. :)
* Submit one PR for *each* solution in *each* programming language.
  * You can choose to solve one challenge in four different programming languages, or solve four exercises in one programming language.
* Place your solution in the appropriate directory under a directory for the language.
    * For example, if you're doing the Mad Lib program in Ruby, create a `ruby` directory under the `madlib` directory. Then in the `ruby` directory, create a directory with your username. The path you'd work in would be `madlib/ruby/your_github_username`
    * Use the `Hello` directory as a guide.
* I've added a `.gitignore` file to try to cover a bunch of misc files. Please don't check in build artifacts, backup files, sensitive info, or other OS or IDE junk. If something is too restrictive in the `.gitignore`, make a PR. :) 
* Please don't copy/steal/plagiarize another person's solution just to get the PRs. Try to work out each one yourself. I'll flag PRs as invalid, and I'll evaluate that at my sole discretion. All decisions are final. Don't peek at other people's PRs.
* You must implement the exercise and follow any **Constraints** specified.
* It's not necessary to complete the **Challenges** section of the exercise, but it is encouraged.
* I will flag junk PRs as invalid in accordance with the letter, and spirit, of Hacktoberfest's rules.
* I will remove the ability to submit PRs entirely if this becomes abused.
